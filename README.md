# hsi
hyperspectral library for python

Hyperspectral imaging presents important current applications in medicine, agriculture, pharmaceutical, space, food and many upcoming applications. The analysis of hyperspectral images requires advanced software. The upcoming developments related to fast hyperspectral imaging, automation and deep learning applications demand innovative software developments for analyzing hyperspectral data. Along this chapter a new software is development based on Python 3. The library is defined as hyperspectral imaging (hsi).

# Instructions for installation

The predetermined work interface is Spyder. Install completely anaconda, check the link: https://www.anaconda.com/. The library comes with 5 different hyperspectral examples and analysis. A manual presents the relevant functions and examples.
Moreover, install the following libraries:

1. conda install -c conda-forge hdbscan

Setting up hsi library:

1.	Download the hsi files that are in the link: https://github.com/darksiders123/hsi 
2.	Set the files in a working path.
3.	Loading the hsi.py in the spyder console by selecting the path of the hsi files.
4.	In spyder console read hsi library by: from hsi import*

Check the examples and manual for understanding how to handle hsi library and data.
